# ETABS Plugin â€“ Advanced Structural Analysis and Post-Processing Tool

A powerful plugin for CSI ETABS that enables engineers to automate structural analysis workflows, extract critical data such as joint displacements and modal periods, apply shear factors based on structural systems, and export results to CSV format.  
Includes features like:

- Save ETABS model copies with a timestamp
- Run analysis & design directly from the plugin
- Extract tables and send them to the server to check the model
- Extract UX/UY displacements for seismic load cases
- Calculate modal periods based on mass participation
- Apply shear coefficients based on structure type
- Live logging and integrated UI (WinForms)
- Auto-updater and GitHub Release integration

> Designed for civil/structural engineers to improve productivity and ensure consistency in ETABS workflows.
